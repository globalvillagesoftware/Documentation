Install Python 3.8.3 on Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop

Overview

This turns out to be quite a laborious job. This is due to a number of corner
cases that are encountered when installing Python on Linux and it all has to be
done manually from the command line. Therefore, I felt it was useful to
document a successful full installation of Python on Ubuntu.

The reasons for difficulty include:
* Python for Linux must be built and installed from source code.
* Ubuntu already has Python 3.8.2 installed and it is used for many components
  of Ubuntu. It is important that the default installation of Python on Ubuntu
  should not be disrupted by the installation of another version of Python.
  
  Python includes a number of optional modules. These modules are not built
  unless the source prerequisites for these modules are present on Ubuntu. If
  you want a complete version of Python you will need to install the
  dependencies of these modules before compiling Python. The compile process
  suggests that you look in the function detect-Â  modules in the source file
  setup.py for module names of the necessary prerequisites but the tests
  contained there are testing whether components within the source dependencies
  are available and this gives little guidance or help on finding the source
  dependencies themselves. You are on your own here.
 
 There are several optional modules that do not have their prerequisite
 components installed on vanilla Ubuntu. These include the following:
 
  * gdbm - Berkley SQL Database
  * LZMA compression
  * ctypes - this seems to be an error

This is a quick survey of the principles of software architecture that is
intended to help us understand why Python states that certain bits are missing
and help us to identify the components that we need to satisfy the Python
requirements.

Installation Procedure
**********************

The installation procedure is written as a Bash script. I would have preferred
to write it in Python but I have to write a lot of low level generic modules
before it becomes practical to write command line scripts in Python. The really
low level pieces are present in Python but the higher level capabilities such
as the handling of commands and pipes are missing.
