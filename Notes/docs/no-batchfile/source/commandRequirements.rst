Commands
########

We are talking here about the management of work on computers. Work that is
done independently from computers is only peripherally relevant to this
discussion.

A Command is an independent unit of work that does not depend on other commands
for successful handling. There is no necessary connection between a command and
the execution of a single program on a computer, although a command is often
implemented though the use of a single computer program.
