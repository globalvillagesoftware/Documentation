An application is a computer program that provides tools to one or more
individuals or organizations to help them achieve their goals. The life-cycle
of an application varies considerably depending on the target environment for
the application.  In addition, the life-cycle of an application intersects
with the life-cycles of its users in complex ways.

These applications are designed to support the goals and operations of an
organization. They are developed within an organization and normally have
little relevance outside of the organization. They are usually developed within
the organization but you do see their development being contracted to
specialist software development organizations
